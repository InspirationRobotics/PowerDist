# PowerDist

`kicad` holds the kicad project / gerber files for the board, and `Power_dist` holds the code running on the microcontroller that actually does the 
hot-swapping.

The [BOM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eEv6u52QYOC_kODey6bpNA8GYwr_zVqGhBdzeqPN1tI/edit?usp=sharing) holds all the internal component references 
that are in the kicad project i.e. component '1,1' is a 102k 0603 resistor.
